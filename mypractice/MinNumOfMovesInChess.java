//"We are given a chess board and a piece with a fixed position (immoveable). We also have a bishop on the board which, well of course, can only move diagonally.
//- Return ""YES"" if we can reach the immoveable piece using the bishop, else return ""NO"".
//- If ""YES"", return the number of minimum steps it takes for the bishop to reach the immoveable piece."
